          <h2>Review Page</h2>
          <p>
            Created a separate page for display reviews. It displays the
            reviews that were read from a XML file. Used JavaScript to read
            the review texts from the XML file. The colours and the hovering
            effects were added to maintain the attractiveness of the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Created an activation form to subscribe a personalized newsletter.
            If the user doesn't fill the form correctly or doesn't fill all fields
            a pop up massage will display saying the error. When a user subscribes
            a newsletter succsessfully, a pop up massage will display saying the 
            subscription is done.
          </p>
          <p>
            Created a form to send the feedbacks. The user has to input the name,
            email and the feedback text. It's compulsory to fill those fields.
            JavaScript is used to validate the form.
